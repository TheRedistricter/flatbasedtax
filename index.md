Proposal for a Simplified Federal Tax System with Flat Rate and Source Collection
Overview

This proposal outlines a comprehensive restructuring of the United States federal tax system by replacing current income, payroll, and capital taxes with a single flat-rate tax on all personal income, collected directly at the source. The key elements are:

A flat tax rate applied uniformly to all income (wages, dividends, capital gains, etc.)

Collected at the source (e.g., by employers, banks, and brokers), eliminating the need for most individuals to file tax returns

Payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare folded into the flat tax

Corporate income taxes eliminated

No deductions, exemptions, or credits

Flat tax rate set and adjusted by the Federal Reserve to moderate inflation or stimulate economic growth

A separate child and family support program replaces the Child Tax Credit

Goals of the Reform

Simplify the tax code

Increase transparency and compliance

Eliminate distortions between labor and capital income

Reinforce trust in federal social programs

Enhance macroeconomic policy tools

Modernize family policy to encourage population growth

Key Features
1. Unified Flat Tax

Applies to all forms of personal income with no differentiation between labor and capital.

Eliminates marginal tax brackets, tax expenditures, and income-specific carveouts.

2. Source-Based Collection

Taxes withheld by income payers (employers, banks, etc.)

Only sole proprietors, partnerships, and similar entities will need to file returns.

3. Elimination of Corporate Income Tax

Shifts taxation fully to the individual level.

Encourages investment, productivity, and domestic capital retention.

4. Payroll Tax Consolidation

Social Security and Medicare taxes merged into the flat tax.

Federal government maintains full obligation to fund these programs.

Contributions no longer capped at ~$168,600; all income is taxed equally.

5. Role of the Federal Reserve

Sets the flat tax rate as a tool for macroeconomic stability.

Can raise rates to reduce inflation or lower them to stimulate growth.

Ensures an independent, data-driven mechanism for economic management.

6. Family and Birthrate Policy

The Child Tax Credit is removed from the tax code.

Replaced by a direct reimbursement program for child care and child-rearing expenses.

Available regardless of income to support higher birth rates and family formation.

Pros
Simplicity & Efficiency

Vastly simplifies tax administration and reduces compliance costs.

No need for most households to file a return.

Economic Neutrality

Eliminates tax biases favoring capital or specific behaviors.

Removes distortions in labor, savings, and investment decisions.

Enhanced Public Trust in Social Insurance

Clarifies that Social Security and Medicare are federal obligations, not trust fund–dependent.

Removes the fiction that these programs can "run out of money."

All income is taxed equally—eliminating the regressive payroll tax cap.

Benefits still tied to earnings and remain progressive in payout.

No Real Loss of Incentives

The high standard deduction already neutralized most tax incentives for:

Charitable giving

Home ownership

Current administration has reduced or phased out many renewable energy incentives

Family support is preserved through direct spending, not tax code manipulation.

Improved Macroeconomic Policy

Fed can integrate fiscal and monetary responses more seamlessly.

Tax changes can be implemented automatically and quickly.

Cons & Challenges
1. Perceived Regressivity

A flat rate may increase the tax burden on lower-income households without careful rate calibration or offsetting benefits.

Redistribution would need to be addressed through separate spending programs.

2. Federal Reserve Overreach Concerns

Expands Fed responsibilities beyond traditional monetary policy.

Requires new institutional checks and transparency mechanisms.

3. Transition Management

Shifting from corporate to individual taxation could require transition rules for retained earnings, deferred income, etc.

Businesses and tax preparers will resist loss of deduction-driven incentives.

4. Residual Filing Requirements

Sole proprietors, gig workers, and informal earners will still require monitoring and filing structures.

Distributional Impact by Income Level
Group	Impact
Low-Income	May pay more without current refundable credits, unless offset by flat rate or direct support. Eliminates payroll taxes. Receives direct child support program.
Middle-Income	Loses deductions and CTC, but gains from no payroll tax and simpler compliance. Family benefits maintained outside tax code.
Upper-Income	Pays tax on all income, including capital gains and income previously above the Social Security cap. May benefit from lower overall rate and elimination of corporate tax.
Top 1%	No more capital gains preference, but large gains from eliminated corporate tax and single rate system. Pays more on labor income.
